# P-and-S

This repository contains the weekly tasks (Problems 2020) for the Programming and Scripting module.  The Programming and Scripting module is part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics which is thought from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.

I was given eight weekly tasks to complete and successfully completed each one as follows:

Task 1:
I introduced myself in the discussion forum and installed the required software on my machine.  I also went to the GitHub website and set up an account for myself.

Task 2:
I wrote a program called ‘bmi.py’ which calculates somebody’s Body Mass Index (BMI).  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter their weight in kg before being asked to enter their height in cm.  Their BMI is then calculated and returned to the user.

Task 3:
I wrote a program called ‘secondstring.py’ which returns every second letter of a sentence in reverse order.  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter a sentence.  Every second letter in reverse order is returned to the user.

Task 4:
I wrote a program called ‘collatz.py’ which returns successive values following calculations.  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter a positive integer.  If the value is even, it’s divided by two and if it’s odd, it’s multiplied by three and added by one.  This process continues until the current value is one.  The successive values are returned to the user.

Task 5:
I wrote a program called ‘weekday.py’ which outputs whether or not the present day is a week day or a weekend day.
