# P-and-S

This repository contains the weekly tasks (Problems 2020) for the Programming and Scripting module.  The Programming and Scripting module is part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics which is thought from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.

I was given eight weekly tasks to complete and successfully completed each one as follows:

Task 1
I introduced myself in the discussion forum and installed the required software on my machine.  I also went to the GitHub website and set up an account for myself.

Task 2
I wrote a program called ‘bmi.py’ which calculates somebody’s Body Mass Index (BMI).  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter their weight in kg before being asked to enter their height in cm.  Their BMI is then calculated and returned to the user.
