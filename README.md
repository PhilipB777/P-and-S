# Programming and Scripting Problems 2020

This repository contains the weekly tasks (Problems 2020) for the Programming and Scripting module.  The Programming and Scripting module is part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics which is taught from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.

I was given eight weekly tasks to complete and successfully completed each one as follows:

### Task One
I introduced myself in the discussion forum and installed the required software on my machine.  I also went to the GitHub website and set up an account for myself.

### Task Two
I wrote a program called **[bmi.py](/bmi.py)** which calculates somebody’s Body Mass Index (BMI).  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter their weight in kg before being asked to enter their height in cm.  Their BMI is then calculated and returned to the user.

### Task Three
I wrote a program called **[secondstring.py](/secondstring.py)** which returns every second letter of a sentence in reverse order.  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter a sentence.  Every second letter in reverse order is returned to the user.

### Task Four
I wrote a program called **[collatz.py](/collatz.py)** which returns successive values following calculations.  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter a positive integer.  If the value is even, it’s divided by two and if it’s odd, it’s multiplied by three and added by one.  This process continues until the current value is one.  The successive values are returned to the user.

### Task Five
I wrote a program called **[weekday.py](/weekday.py)** which outputs whether the present day is a weekday or a weekend day.  When the program is run, the user sees whether today is a weekday or a weekend day.

### Task Six
I wrote a program called **[squareroot.py](/squareroot.py)** which returns an approximation of a number’s square root.   When the program is run, the user is asked to enter a positive number.  The approximation of its square root is returned to the user.

### Task Seven
I wrote a program called **[es.py](/es.py)** which outputs the number of e’s contained in a text file.  When the program is run, the user is asked to enter a file name.  The total number of e’s within the file text is returned to the user.

### Task Eight
I wrote a program called **[plot.py](/plot.py)** which displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x² and h(x)=x³ in the range 0 - 4.  When the program is run, a scatterplot is displayed to the user.
